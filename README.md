# RA Base Building Fix for Vanilla++ Admin Tools
# Overview
- This fix for the RA Base Building mod enhances the building experience by integrating with Vanilla++ Admin Tools to streamline the construction process. With this fix, you can build structures in Admin Mode without needing materials, instantly create holograms in TIER 1, upgrade structures with just a hammer, and bypass terrain and adjacent building checks.

# Features
- Material-Free Building: When Admin Mode is activated using Vanilla++ Admin Tools, you can now build structures without requiring any materials. This feature is ideal for administrators and modders who need to test or set up builds quickly.

- Automatic Hologram Creation: Upon placing a structure, the fix automatically creates the hologram in TIER 1. This eliminates the need to manually construct the hologram, saving time and effort during setup.

- Instant TIER Upgrades: Upgrading the structure's TIER is simplified; you only need to use a hammer to increase the TIER of your built structure. This streamlines the building process and allows for quick upgrades without additional tools or materials.

- Bypass Terrain and Adjacent Building Checks: The fix removes the terrain and adjacent building checks, allowing you to build structures regardless of the surrounding environment or nearby constructions.
